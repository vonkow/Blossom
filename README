Blossom: A rosewood.js gameserver using node

Requirements:
	node.js
	A copy of rosewood.js located at ../Rosewood/ (relative to blossom).

Usage:
	Run 'node server.js' from the command line to start the server.
	Open 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' in a browser to see a demo.

	Modify app.js to change and add server-side game settings and functions.
	Modify play.html to change client-side game settings.

Notes:
	Incredibly rough draft idea at the moment. May be prone to breaking.
	You'll probably have to pull the latest versions of rosewood and node occasionally to keep blossom working.
